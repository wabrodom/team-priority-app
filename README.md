👋 Welcome to Team Priority App, I designed to help small teams prioritize tasks.

The mock users consist of five individuals.
1. boss : iamboss@0
2. rose : rose@1
3. lisa : lisa@2
4. matt : matt@3
5. chris : chris@4

With the help of ChatGPT and some googling, I've created what I believe to be my best Node.js app for now. 
I spent countless hours and days to bring this app to showable state and make it available to the public.
